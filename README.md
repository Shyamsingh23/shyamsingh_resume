## Project 1: Classification Model Evaluation

This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models for a binary classification task using a dataset (dataset.csv).
Features:

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

        Removal of missing values

        Feature scaling using StandardScaler

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

        Histograms, count plots, and correlation heatmaps

## Model Training and Evaluation:

        Logistic Regression

        K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

        Dummy Classifier (baseline)

        Accuracy, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix

## ROC Curve Visualization

    Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV
    
## Tools Used:

    Python

    pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

    
## Project 2: Multi-Level Network and Business Insight Analysis

This project applies network analysis to explore company-director relationships and link them to business performance using multiple datasets.
Features:

## Bipartite Graph Creation with NetworkX

    Centrality Analysis:

        Degree, Eigenvector, and Betweenness Centrality

## Data Integration:

        Merging of director and company datasets

## Clustering:

        DBSCAN for grouping similar entities

## Business Feature Analysis:

        Revenue, global presence, year founded, director roles

## Visualizations:

        Network diagrams, bar charts, scatter plots
## Tools Used:

    Python

    pandas, numpy, networkx, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
    
## Outcome:

This project connects network structures to real-world business metrics, enabling insights into corporate influence and performance.
